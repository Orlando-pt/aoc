# Advent of Code 2021 in Lua

Let's dominate AoC 2021 ðŸŽ„!

- [Day01](./solution/day01) â˜…â˜…

â˜… = completed the solution
â˜† = had to get help

## Usage

I firstly test my solutions in the `test` folder. Here is an example:

```shell
make test d=01
```

or

```shell
lua test/day01/day01.lua
```

The solutions are executed from the root folder like this:

```shell
lua main.lua 1
```

The output has the following structure(no spoilers):

```
Day 1:
-----------------
Part 1:         0
Time:   1.1e-05
-----------------
Part 2:         0
Time:   4.05e-06
-----------------
```
