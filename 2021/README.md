# Advent of Code 2021 in Lua

Let's dominate AoC 2021 ðŸŽ„!

- [Day01](./solution/day01/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day02](./solution/day02/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day03](./solution/day03/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day04](./solution/day04/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day05](./solution/day05/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day06](./solution/day06/main.lua) â˜…â˜…
- [Day07](./solution/day07/main.lua) â˜…â˜…

â˜… = completed the solution
â˜† = had to get help

## Usage

I firstly test my solutions in the `test` folder. Here is an example:

```shell
make test d=01
```

or

```shell
lua test/day01/main.lua
```

The solutions are executed from the root folder like this:

```shell
lua main.lua 1
```

The output has the following structure(no spoilers):

```
Day 1:
-----------------
Part 1:  0
Time:    0.01s
-----------------
Part 2:  2
Time:    2.9s
-----------------
```
