# Advent of Code 2023 in Go 🐭

Let's dominate AoC 🎄! My goal is **not to get 50 stars, with a great solution**, I do AoC to learn a new language in a fun way.

- [Day01](./solution/day01) ★★
- [Day02](./solution/day02) ★★
- [Day03](./solution/day03) ☆★
- [Day04](./solution/day04) ★★
- [Day05](./solution/day05) ★★
- [Day06](./solution/day06) ★★
- [Day07](./solution/day07) ★★

★ = completed the solution
☆ = had to get help

## Usage

I firstly test my solutions in the `test` folder. Here is an example:

```shell
make test d=01
```

or

```shell
go test ./test/day01
```

The solutions are executed from the root folder like this:

```shell
go run . 01
```

The output has the following structure(no spoilers):

```
===== 01 =====
Part 1: 5459
Part 1 took 53.584µs
Part 2: 5454
Part 2 took 11.4055ms
```
