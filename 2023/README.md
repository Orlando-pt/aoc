# Advent of Code 2023 in Go 🐭

This is my 1st attempt of AoC 🎄! My goal is **not to get 50 stars, with a great solution**, I do AoC to learn a new language in a fun way

- [Day01](./day01) ★★
- [Day02](./day02) ★★
- [Day03](./day03) ☆★
- [Day04](./day04) ★★

★ = completed the solution
☆ = had to get help

## Usage

I firstly test my solutions in the `test` folder. Here is an example:

```shell
cd test/day01 
go test
```

The solutions are executed from the root folder like this:

```shell
go run . 01
```

```

Part 1 took 53.584µs

Part 2 took 11.4055ms
```
